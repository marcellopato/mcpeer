Hi Laravel community! 👋

I'm excited to share **MCPeer**, a new Laravel project I've been working on that brings visual management to Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

## What is MCPeer?
MCPeer is a Laravel-powered platform that lets you create and manage MCP servers through a visual interface, without complex manual coding.

## Laravel Features Used:
- ⚡ Laravel 10.x with PHP 8.1+
- 🎨 Blade templates + TailwindCSS + Alpine.js
- 🐳 Docker + Docker Compose setup
- 🔄 GitHub Actions CI/CD
- 📚 Full PSR-12 compliance
- 🧪 PHPUnit testing structure

## Why Laravel?
Laravel's elegant syntax and powerful features make it perfect for building MCP management tools:
- Artisan commands for MCP generation
- Eloquent ORM for configuration management  
- Built-in authentication for API security
- Job queues for background MCP processing

## Getting Started:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcellopato/mcpeer.git
cd mcpeer
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec app composer install
```

## Current Status: 
🟡 Alpha release (v1.0.0-alpha) - Foundation complete, MCP features in development

Would love feedback from the Laravel community! What MCP integrations would you find most useful?

🚀 Introducing MCPeer - Visual MCP Server Management

Hey MCP community! I've built a platform to make MCP server creation and management visual and standardized.

## The Problem MCPeer Solves:
- ❌ MCP implementation requires deep protocol knowledge
- ❌ Manual coding for every API integration
- ❌ No standardized way to manage multiple MCP servers
- ❌ Difficult to test and validate MCP responses

## MCPeer's Approach:
- ✅ Visual interface for MCP actions (query, mutation, stream)
- ✅ Auto-generates MCP server code and Docker configs
- ✅ Built-in testing and validation tools
- ✅ Standardized API integration patterns

## MCP Features:
🔧 **Action Types**: Full support for query, mutation, stream
🔐 **Authentication**: Token, Basic, OAuth2 integration
📡 **Real-time**: Live testing of MCP responses
📦 **Export**: Complete MCP server with Dockerfile
🎯 **Visual Config**: No manual JSON/YAML editing

## Technical Stack:
- Laravel/PHP backend for MCP generation
- TailwindCSS frontend for visual configuration
- Docker containerization for deployment
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Roadmap:
- Phase 1: Complete MCP Actions CRUD ⏳
- Phase 2: AI-powered action generation
- Phase 3: MCP template marketplace

## Demo & Code:
🌐 Demo: https://marcellopato.github.io/mcpeer (pending GitHub Pages)
💻 Code: https://github.com/marcellopato/mcpeer
📄 Release: v1.0.0-alpha available

Looking for feedback on MCP protocol implementation and community needs!
